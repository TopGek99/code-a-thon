## Instructions

All files can be tested normally by running the "python" or "python3" command in conjunction with the file name.

For task3, when the it asks "Do you want to use default data?", it refers to the data given in the PDFs within the funding_applications folder. For this to work,
the pdfminer3 library for python must be installed by first running the command `pip install pdfminer3`, as the data is taken directly from the PDFs. If the use of external libraries is not allowed for solutions then you can answer "n" to the question in order to get it to use the data that was stored from task2.
