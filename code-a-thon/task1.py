# There are four factors with weighting, eg Founder(0.3), Industry(0.3),
# Traction(0.35) and Gut (0.05) for start-ups
# final rating(eg; P1, P2, P3, P4) is sum of all the factors multiplied with it's respective weighting. 
# 4.0 - 5.0 = P1
# 2.5 - 4.0 = P2
# 1.0 - 2.5 = P3
# 0.0 - R   = P4 
# So a start-up's four factor rating can be inputed. Program will output the final rating
